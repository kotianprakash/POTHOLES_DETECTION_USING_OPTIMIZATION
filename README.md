# Pothole Detection Using Optimization
Introduction
This project aims to detect potholes on the road using image processing and optimization techniques. The idea is to analyze the images captured by a camera mounted on a vehicle and identify potholes based on their characteristics.



The program will prompt you to enter the path to the image file you want to analyze. Enter the path and press Enter.
The program will display the original image and the image with the identified potholes marked.
The program will also display the number of potholes detected and the coordinates of their centers.

## Algorithm
The algorithm used to detect potholes is based on optimization techniques. Here's how it works:

The program reads in an image captured by a camera mounted on a vehicle.
The program applies various image processing techniques to enhance the features of the image that are relevant to potholes.
The program uses optimization techniques to identify the most likely locations of potholes in the image.
The program marks the identified potholes on the image and displays it to the user.

## Conclusion
Pothole detection using optimization is a promising technique for improving road safety. This project demonstrates how optimization techniques can be used to identify potholes in images captured by a vehicle-mounted camera. With further development and refinement, this technique could be integrated into vehicle safety systems to detect potholes in real-time and alert drivers to potential hazards.
